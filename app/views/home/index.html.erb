  The Babylon bibliography is a project directed by Olof Pedersén and Eva Cancik-Kirschbaum. Raija Mattila, 
  Helsinki, did most of the original collection of references. Later Felix Levenson, Berlin, made structural 
  changes to the material. The bibliographical information is available as Open Access.
